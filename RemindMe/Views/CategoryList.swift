/**
 * One of the coolest things I've found thus far in SwiftUI is using
 * `@Binding` and `@State` to automate the selection / deselection of
 * mutually exclusive controls (e.g., buttons in a radio group).
 *
 * A `RadioPill` is a pill-shaped button in a radio group. This control
 * is used primarily to switch between categories of reminders.
 */

    /**
     * The text being displayed within the pill.

    @State var label: String


    /**
     * The index of this selection within the broader radio group.
     */
    @State var index: Int


    /**
     * The global selection index. When this button is tapped, we will
     * set the value of `selection` to `index`, and this information will
     * be sent to each of the other buttons in the radio group. In effect,
     * this is less efficient than, say, running the following pseudocode:
     *
     * ```
     * buttons[currentSelection].setColor(UIColor.systemGray5)
     * currentSelection = tappedButtonIndex
     * buttons[currentSelection].setColor(UIColor.blue)
     * ```
     *
     * The above code runs in constant time, whereas the SwiftUI code sends
     * updates to each of the the `n - 2` buttons that don't need them.
     * However, one must also consider the cool factor of doing it the SwiftUI
     * way. No doubt: SwiftUI's way is just cooler.
